## Fitting ARMA models

`@script`
In this chapter we will cover how to fit the AR, MA and ARMA models we have been learning about; and crucially, how to pick between them


---
## ARMA models from statsmodels

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "45b5c0a6a7"
```

`@part1`
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA
```

- p: number of autoregression lags{{2}}
- q: number of moving average lags{{2}}

```python
model = ARMA(df_train, order=(p,q))
```{{2}}


`@script`
We import the ARMA model from the statmodels package like this.

*To fit a model, first we instantiate the model object, passing it the data and the order.

This is our first issue, how do we choose the order?


---
## Choosing a Model

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "84d44d8f3d"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
By simply looking at a time series is hard to choose an appropriate model and order. These two time series look very similar, but suit different models. If we make the wrong choice of model, we can end up with inaccurate forecasts.


---
## The (Partial) Autocorrelation Function

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "918ab6f697"
```

`@part1`
**ACF - Autocorrelation Function**

Correlation at lag-step n{{1}}


`@part2`
**PACF - Partial Autocorrelation Function**

Correlation at lag-step n which isn't due to correlation at lag-step less than n{{2}}


`@script`
In order to choose a model we can use the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF)
 
*The ACF tells us how much our time series is correlated with itself at a lag of n time-steps

*The PACF tells us how much our time series is correlated with itself at a lag of n time-steps after removing the correlations caused by smaller lags

We can use these two metrics to decide what kind of model is the best fit to our data

## Autocorrelation functions of AR and MA

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "0d45af2765"
```

`@part1`
**AR(1)**
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/cf381f21e06d00a2a8a3c126a7cd18b728fdd634/AR1_acf_only.png)

`@part2`



`@script`
If the data is from an AR model then the ACF should tail off gradually. The PACF should drop off suddenly after lag p.

In this example, you can see that the PACF drops off after lag 1. This suggests an AR(1) model. 

Note that the area shaded in blue shows the values of ACF and PACF which are not statistically significant

## Autocorrelation functions of AR and MA

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "dfe9a442f9"
```

`@part1`
**AR(1)**
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/cf381f21e06d00a2a8a3c126a7cd18b728fdd634/AR1_acf_only.png)

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/31c38267134d29a1800704c77924ee2e97cdc2a2/AR1_pacf_only.png)


`@part2`
**MA(1)**
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/3609fa97b316a9a73758d118d08a18c7cb5fc79a/MA1_acf_only.png)

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/7fa9cb117d0e26cce7e39904d10d41fd18c8d042/MA1_pacf_only.png)


`@script`
If the data is characterised by an MA model then the ACF will drop off suddenly after lag q and the PACF will tail off gradually. 

In the right plot, you can see that the ACF drops off after lag 1 and the amplitude of PACF tails off gradually but oscillates between positive and negative. This suggests an MA(1) model

## Autocorrelation functions of ARMA

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "809513f38f"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/a282ba489c48e40ab703f7a88dff7e5091e6bf69/ARMA11_pacf.png)


`@script`
If the data is characterised by an ARMA model then both the ACF and the PACF tail off. 

In this case it is harder to pick the model parameters p and q. We will come back to this challenge later.

## ACF and PACF Summary Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "19fd4879f3"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/7a3fcce90d063c3fed1bec4ee1045ce75f4114e0/acf_table.PNG)


`@script`
The following table summarises what we have just covered about ACF and PACF. You will use this in the exercises to choose appropriate models


---
## ACF and PCF Code

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "525900e8c9"
```

`@part1`
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
fig1 = sm.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(df_train, lags=20)
fig2 = sm.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(df_train, lags=20)
plt.show()
```


![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/be292285da6463e6abe467897e2661b57ff3599c/AR1_pacf.png)


`@script`
To generate these plots in the exercises you will use the plot_acf and plot_pacf functions from the graphics submodule of statsmodels. Here df_train is our time series and lags=20 is the maximum number of lags we would like to see plotted

## Flu Time Series

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "3c379cc01a"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/4ce204196f99a42a819a5bd8a31c8393bf847b83/fake_flu_all.png)


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/7a3fcce90d063c3fed1bec4ee1045ce75f4114e0/acf_table.PNG){{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/a282ba489c48e40ab703f7a88dff7e5091e6bf69/ARMA11_pacf.png){{1}}


`@script`
Now we have a method to choose between models, lets go ahead and fit one. The following is a fictitious data set showing flu rates. Our task is to model the data and make future predictions of how many people will become sick.

*Here the ACF and PACF both tail off, so we'll use an ARMA model


---
## Fitting the Flu

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "293ab0de72"
```

`@part1`
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA
```

- p: number of autoregression lags
- q: number of moving average lags

```python
model = ARMA(df_train, order=(1,1))
```

```python
results = model.fit()
```{{1}}


`@script`
We import the ARMA model as before and instantiate it.
We'll use p and q both equal to 1. This is the simplest ARMA model.

*Next we call the model's fit method and assign the returned ARMA-results-object to a variable.


---
## Predicting the Flu

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c96a001216"
```

`@part1`
```python
future_predictions = results.get_prediction(start='2018-09-08')
```
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/8eb3d1da5be9e92d010e7fd07fe3397ca2747240/fake_flu_pred.png)


`@script`
Using the fitted model we can now make predictions about future flu rates using the get_predictions method. We'll discuss forecasts further in a later video but lets zoom in for a closer look to see how our model performs


---
## Comparing Predictions to Truth

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1598f4afa5"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4399/datasets/21235f85b3ec5d0e9d03dc2f771d79411a95ef57/fake_flu_pred_zoom.png)


`@script`
Not bad! Our predictions line up pretty well with the held out data.


---
## Let's  practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "8ca7b9d309"
```

`@script`
Now we have seen how to choose and fit time series models, it is your turn to try. Let's practice!
